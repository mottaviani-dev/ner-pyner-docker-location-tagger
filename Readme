Stanford NER is a named entity recognition tool that uses a combination of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and artificial neural networks to identify and categorize named entities in unstructured text into predefined categories like person names, organizations, locations, and more. https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml

This code performs location tagging of text files in a given directory using a NER.

It identifies location entities in the text files and stores the results in a JSON file.

#Usage
The main function uses the locations_tag function to find the location terms in text files in the locations directory. The resulting dictionary of locations is then written to a JSON file named locations.json.

#Dependencies
This code depends on the following packages:

`csv`
`os`
`ner`
`sys`
`json`
